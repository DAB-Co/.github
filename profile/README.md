# JAM

Jam is an application that matches people with the same favorite colors and lets them chat.

Everyone gets 1 match per day at the same hour. Inactive accounts do not get a match.

Initially, it used to match by a user's top songs in Spotify, however permission
wasn't given by Spotify to use their API publicly.
